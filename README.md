# Image_Recognition
Deep Learning applied to a Kaggle competition - Humpback Whale Identification Challenge.

Can you identify a whale by the picture of its fluke?

In my R code I train 2 models for image recognition of whaleâ€™s id by a picture of its fluke. The first one is a VGG16 model with 2 additional dense layers(accuracy of 0.31160 on test set) & the second one is a CNN model(accuracy of 0.32716 on test set). 
At the time of submission in Kaggle, my place  on the leaderboard was 337 out of 454.
